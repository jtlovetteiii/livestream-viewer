# livestream-viewer
Self-contained passive live-stream viewer with support for off-air and off-line static videos.

# Use-Case
This application was designed to solve a specific use-case: continuously displaying a live video feed on a display device. It does so by periodically testing a configured live-stream URL for frame data, then displaying either the stream (if the test succeeded), a configured "Off-Air" video (if the test failed but Internet connectivity is available), or an "Offline" video (if the test failed and Internet connectivity is unavailable). To ensure maximum compatibility across platforms and devices, this application relies on simple, no-frills video players such as FFPLAY and OMXPLAYER.

# Technology

# Supported Stream Types
Currently, only RTMP streams have been tested. However, any streaming protocol supported by FFPLAY and OMXPLAYER is theoretically supported.
